// Extend the User Story 6 to implement a CharacterPatternMap class to encapsulate
// character-to-pattern mappings. The application retrieves and displays the "OOPS"
// banner using these mappings. Thereby addressing the drawback of not having
// centralized character pattern management system.

// Key Requirements:
// 1. Create CharacterPatternMap class to hold character and its pattern
// 2. Implement methods to create and retrieve character patterns
// 3. Use CharacterPatternMap to display the "OOPS" banner
// 4. Implement modular and reusable character pattern management

// Drawback of this approach is that we are creating CharacterPatternMap objects
// for each character, which may not be the most efficient approach for large sets.
